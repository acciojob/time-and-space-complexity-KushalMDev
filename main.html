 <h1>Exploring Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>

  <p>
    Time complexity is a crucial concept in algorithm analysis. It measures the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to execute as a function of the input size. Efficient algorithms have lower time complexity, meaning they perform well even as the input size grows.
  </p>

  <p>
    Space Complexity refers to the amount of memory space an algorithm requires to complete its execution. It is often denoted by the Big O notation, such as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size. Understanding <b>Space Complexity</b> is vital for designing algorithms that use memory efficiently and can scale gracefully.
